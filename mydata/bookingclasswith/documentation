The function Fare_PricePNRWithBookingClass is used to price itineraries.
========================================================================
It can return one or several fare recommendations for the passenger(s) and for the itinerary of the active PNR.
Only booking classes present in the flight segment of the PNR are considered.
========================================================================
After calling the Fare_PricePNRWithBookingClass function, the system keeps the recommendations stored
internally for three minutes in a dedicated context. This context can be used to create a Transitional Stored
Ticket (TST) by using Ticket_CreateTSTFromPricing.
